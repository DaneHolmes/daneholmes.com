				<p>I currently live in Chicago, but prior to living here, I lived in Tokyo, Japan. After graduating from Lane Tech College Prep in 2017, I went to Truman College and graduated as a Presidential Scholar with an Associate of Arts degree in a year and a half. After finishing community college, before starting at Northwestern, I worked for the Chicago Public Library as a Cyber Navigator. There, I traveled all over Chicago helping amazing people with countless issues, and I would not trade the experience for anything.</p>
				<p>Outside of school and work, I spend my time making websites, like this one, teaching myself programming, and, recently, learning as much as I can about computer networking and privacy. Outside of computers, I row for the Northwestern crew team, try to read and write, and play lacrosse pretty casually.</p>
