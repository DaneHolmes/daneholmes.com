				<p>Following are some of my selected projects and writings. Some of the these have been done for fun, self-education, or for school. These projects cover a range of practices and this list by no way complete—just what I feel like sharing at the moment. If you're interesting in seeing more work, reach out, I'm more than happy to share.</p>

				<p>I currently live in Evanston, Illinois, but prior to living here, I lived in Chicago and Tokyo. After graduating from Lane Tech College Prep in 2017, I went to Truman College and graduated as a Presidential Scholar with an Associate of Arts degree in a year and a half. After finishing community college, but before starting at Northwestern, I worked for the Chicago Public Library as a Cyber Navigator. There, I traveled all over Chicago helping amazing people with countless issues, and I would not trade the experience for anything.</p>
				<p>Outside of school and work, I spend my teaching myself programming, learning as much as possible about various useless subjects, and reading the wikipedia page about everything I encounter. Outside of that, I row for the Northwestern crew team, boulder, religiously watch the Chicago Cubs, try to read and write, and play lacrosse.</p>
